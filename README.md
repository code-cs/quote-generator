# quote-generator
A random quote generator website. It  makes an asynchronous fetch request to a rest API in order to get random quotes.
There are two buttons on the quote window, one to get a new quote and the other button we have is a Twitter button. So when we click on the twitter icon, it will open Twitter in a new tab and if we were logged in we can tweet the quote.
This project is mobile friendly and thatâ€™s about the size of most large smartphones and the quote container is fitting the size of the screen on smartphones, and it has a little bit of a margin on both sides.
